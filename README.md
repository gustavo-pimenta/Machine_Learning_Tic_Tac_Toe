# Machine_Learning_Tic_Tac_Toe
A Tic Tac Toe game that uses a Decision Tree Module to study older moves and decise the next move 

To play, just download all files (in the same folder) and run the script
Remember to install python and the librarys
 
The game was developed with Python Pygame
Using the Machine Learning Decision Tree module from SKLearn
Libs: Pygame and SKLearn

When the CPU wins the game, it write the moves used in the database
This move database is used to study and decise the next move to win the game

This project was made by Gustavo Pimenta, to study about Machine Learning
